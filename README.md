-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   Black, White, and Grey were used for a very clean, minimalistic look that would clash with the multitude of colours from the album covers.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The Beatles Logo itself acts as the Home button and fits in very well with the colour scheme.
        -   All four of the headshots on the home page were chosen for their consistency. The Beatles are all of similar age and it gives the impression that they are available to be booked.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to find out information about The Beatles and the individual members.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are immediately greeted with a clean home page that tells them some history about the Band's origins and their influence on the world of music.
        2. Beneath the band information, users can read a little bit about each band member's role within the group and the songs that were attributed to them.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be minimalistic and devoid of clutter so that the user can navigate easily through it.
        2. The navigation bar is fixed to ensure that users will never lose sight of how to move around within the website.
        3. The dropdown Navigational bar on smaller devices enables a tidier Nav bar for the user.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to learn about their albums and listen to their music.
        1. The discography page shows the user all of the Studio albums made by The Beatles and the album artwork used for them.
        2. By clicking on the album artwork or title the user can learn endless information about said album though the wikipedia page that opens in a new tab.
        3. The Media page provides five music videos displaying the wide range of music The Beatles were famous for.

-   #### Returning Visitor/Fan Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor/Fan, I want access to their discography and music in one clean place.

        1. The discography page provides all 12 Studio Album artworks and links to their wikipedia pages in one place.
        2. The Media page provides youtube videos of The Beatles that can be watched/listened to. More videos of their catalogue could be uploaded.

    2. As a Returning Visitor/Fan, I want access to all of The Beatles Social Media sites from one location.

        1. The website provides fans with a 'favourite' page that has links to every Beatles social media site.

    3. As a Returning Visitor/Fan, I want to book to see my favourite band live!
        1. The user can easily book to see the band live by completing the forms on the Book Us Page and selecting a date.
        2. Currently, if all forms have been completed correctly, the page will refresh once the form has been submitted. This is due to the fact that no javascript has been used because of the guidelines of this project. No Method has entered as part of the form.
